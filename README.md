#Battle Base
  Battle Base is a strategy, single player(For now) war game where you build and upgrade your base, gather resources and battle with other (computer based) players.
 
  This game will be desinged and developed, mostly by HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I will learn and make use of other languages as needed.
  However, I might use JSON, or any other method, for storing information on the user's computer in order to keep all data and progress when the user close the page, or 
  turn off the computer. I might even need to use the user's storage to handle form validation and so on...
  
  If you are familiar with games like 1. Moonbase (very popular on Mxit), or Zorg Empire ( I will add a link below ), then you already know the big picture of this game. 
  For the Demo of Battle base, it will be an offline, single player game with added pre-programmed bots.The player will be able to explore all the capebilities of the game, as
  well as competing agaisnt build in bots, programmed to be able to develop, rebuild and progress, independent just like other players would. I might even go so far to say some
  of them could be able to interact and communicate with the player.
  
  The Demo version will only include the key functions of the game and some other extra functions. More content and features in the Demo can be unlocked with VIP Membership only.   While the game is being developed until its tested and running, I will use the time to gather ideas and suggestions about features, thhemes, different modes, more graphics,       content etc. When the Demo is active, there will be a series of updates regularly to imporove the game and add new and requested content and suggestions. So far very little       coding has been done. I started planning the general aspecs of the game about 8 months ago but didnt put much thought to it. Last month I decided to dedicate my full focus on     designing and developing the game. So far I have most of all layouts and styles designed on paper as well as planning for JavaScript and how some parts of the
  game is going to operate.
  
  There will be a "Leaderboard" to show everyone's(including bots) Stats. 1. "Base Stats" is obtained by Building upgrades, Tech research, Population and Total Units.
  2. "Battle Stats" is obtained by attacks and defences. 3. "Interactive Stats" is different stats obtained during Quests and Campaign mode.
  4. "Achievements" unlocks when the player reaches certain levels. 5. "Medals" is obtained by top 5 players. All these stats are being calculated into one one
  value which is called "Rank". The value of Stats will determine the player's place on the Leaderboard between 1 and the ammount of all active players/bots, after
  each week. Each week, "Battle Stats" and "Improvement Stats" will reses, to start each "Weekly Trial" on a fresh start. However, each player/bot will
  remain on the same Rank Position, and as the game moves on and the stats begin to increase, everyone will be assinged new positions according to how their
  "Stats" are progressing. After each "Weekly Trail" the players/bots who is found in Rank 1 to 3 gets rewarded with a Medal for that Stat, Large resources
  bundles including Gold. Rank 1 gets VIP for 30 Days, Rank 2 gets VIP for 20 days, Rank 3 gets VIP for 10 days.
  Rank 4 to 10 will only get achievements, resources and Gold. Gold can also be used to activate VIP Membership for a limmit ammount of time.
  
  
  
  I'm completely against games that is "Pay to win", Thats why I will not allow Battle Base, to be the kind of game where the value of someone's wealth, determine their
  progress in the game. The 1 rule that define Battle Base is **Strategy and Tactics**. The best player is defined by the strategic gameplay being used. When two players
  use the excact same strategic gameplay, both accounts will evolve at the same rate, an other effective matter is Time. If using the excact same gameplays and tactics,
  the most active player's stats will definatly increase faster then the other. While the base is Idling, other players can catch up fast and Overtake your Rank.
